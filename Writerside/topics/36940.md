Google is looking into an Android 14 bug that’s been wreaking havoc for people with multiple user profiles. On October 27th, a [Google representative acknowledged](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/305766503#comment384) the bug and said the team is “working hard on a fix” for it.

> Thanks for sticking with us. Our team is looking into this storage issue affecting some Pixel devices running Android 14 and we're working hard on a fix. We'll update this thread with more details soon.

While the first reports [were mostly from Pixel 6 owners](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23919957/pixel-6-android-14-upgrade-bugs-multiple-user-profiles) who experienced the problem as the update started rolling out, [_Ars Technica_](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/android-14s-ransomware-data-storage-bug-locks-out-users-remains-unfixed/) reported this week that a Google issue tracker for the problem had grown beyond over 350 replies, extending to owners of many different devices. The problems range from missing apps to constant crashes to being locked out of internal storage entirely on one of their device’s user accounts.

As of now, the issue tracker has over 420 replies, with some users pasting in log files or uploading pictures of the phone’s screen. [Multiple](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/305766503#comment222) [users](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/305766503#comment61) said they can’t provide on-device screenshots because the phone reports it has no available storage to save them to. Several likened the experience to being infected with ransomware.
