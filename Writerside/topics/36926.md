Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday the ground operation launched by Israeli troops in Gaza was the second stage in a war against the Islamist group Hamas that would be long and difficult.

Speaking at a news conference, he said every effort would be made to rescue the more than 200 hostages held by Hamas.
