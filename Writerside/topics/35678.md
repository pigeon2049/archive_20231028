Hundreds of protesters demanding a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas forced officials on Friday to close Grand Central Terminal, one of New York City's major transit hubs, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said.

"Grand Central Terminal is closed until further notice due to a protest," the MTA said on its website, urging commuters to use alternate stations and plan for extra travel time.

Images on social media showed protesters pouring out of the train station and onto 42nd Street in Midtown Manhattan.

"Mourn the dead, and fight like hell for the living," read one banner raised inside the building.

The demonstration was organized by a group called Jewish Voice for Peace, the New York Times reported.

Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that rules Gaza, said its militants were ready to confront Israeli attacks with "full force."
