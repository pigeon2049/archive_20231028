Abstract:

Earlier this week, the seller of the domain, LiveMax Health and Wellness, filed for an IPO. Documents indicate that the company gained $1.8 million in revenue from the sale of an intangible asset (namely, the Max.com domain) in 2022.

According to foreign media reports, the well-known U.S. entertainment company HBO recently spent about $1.8 million (roughly more than 13 million RMB) to acquire the three-letter domain Max.com. This transaction was disclosed in the seller's initial public offering (IPO) filing. HBO focuses on producing and broadcasting television programs and movies, requiring subscription payments for viewing. The full name of the company is 'Home Box Office'. Earlier this year, HBO underwent a rebranding, officially changing to Max. Prior to the company's brand reshaping, it acquired Max.com. The domain perfectly matches the brand MAX, highlighting the importance for a company to have a matching domain for its brand.

Three-letter domain names, due to their simplicity, rich implications, and industry-unrestricted nature, have significant investment potential, making them highly favored by both businesses and investors. In 2023, many companies have acquired and begun using three-letter domain names, such as PDN.com, RSC.com, PFA.com, KHY.com, and more. Many of the Fortune 500 companies are also using concise three-letter domain names, for instance: Apple's MAC.com, Amazon's AWS.com, BYD's BYD.com, China Construction Bank's CCB.com, as well as BMW's BMW.com, and so on.
