Australian police said on Saturday they charged a man in a case involving two pythons on the loose after the snakes were dumped in a residential area of Sydney.

The 2.5-metre (8.2-foot) pet pythons escaped after the man took them from a secure enclosure and dumped them in a box outside a residence on Oct. 21 in what police said in a statement was "a domestic related incident".

The owner of the snakes – a 25-year-old woman – reported the snakes missing to police, who charged the man with damaging property. He was due in court on Saturday.

According to the Guardian Australia [news site](https://amp.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/27/sydney-suburb-coogee-two-pet-pythons-snakes-dumped-in-fit-of-anger), Sydney residents have been searching city streets to try to rescue the pet pythons, named Mango and Bagel, allegedly dumped in anger by the man, who was the woman's ex-boyfriend.
